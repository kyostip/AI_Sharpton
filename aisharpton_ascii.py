This is a python script meant to automate the process of scraping
tweets based on key words from X.com and generating responses to 
them using the LLAMA3 LLM model from Google. The responses 
attempt to resemble a slightly hyperbolic satirical version Al Sharpton.
The generated responses can then be sent to an account through the
X.com API, in this case @AI_Sharpton

This project is not to be taken seriously and is simply a bit of juvenile fun
while familiriazing one-self with working with self-hosted LLM models.
